This is a calender thats allows users to save events for their work day hour-by-hour. The calender is ran by dynamically updated HTML and CSS and powered by jQuery. When you enter an event in the time-blocks, it will be saved into local storage accordingly with the time and date it was entered. The current day is displayed at the top of the calender.
